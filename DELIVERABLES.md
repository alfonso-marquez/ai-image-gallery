## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes (serverless)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (public bucket)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth (email/password)
- **AI Services**:
  - AWS Rekognition (tags + colors)
  - OpenAI GPT-4o-mini Vision (descriptions)
  - AWS Bedrock (optional fallback)

### Database Schema

```sql
-- images table: stores file paths and URLs
CREATE TABLE images (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  filename VARCHAR(255),
  original_path TEXT,
  thumbnail_path TEXT,
  uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- image_metadata table: AI-generated analysis results
CREATE TABLE image_metadata (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  image_id INTEGER REFERENCES images(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  description TEXT,
  tags TEXT[],
  colors VARCHAR(7)[],
  ai_processing_status VARCHAR(20),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- RLS policies ensure users only see their own data
```

### AI Provider System

```
src/lib/ai/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts                # AIProvider interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts                # Provider registry + main API
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rekognition.ts     # AWS Rekognition
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ openai-vision.ts   # OpenAI Vision
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bedrock.ts         # AWS Bedrock
```

**Key Innovation**: Environment-based provider selection allows switching AI services without code changes.

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### Per Image Processing Cost

- **Rekognition** (tags + colors): $0.001
- **OpenAI** (description): $0.0003
- **Total**: **$0.0013 per image**

### Projected Monthly Cost (1000 images)

- AI processing: $1.30
- Supabase (free tier): $0
- Vercel (free tier): $0
- **Total**: **~$1.50/month** for 1000 images

**Scaling**: At 10,000 images/month, cost is ~$13-15 (still very affordable)

- [x] Check tags include OCR text and parent categories
- [x] Verify colors extracted correctly (top 3 dominant)
- [x] Test description is factual (no hallucinations)
- [x] Search by text (tags, description, filename)
- [x] "Find similar" feature works (Jaccard similarity)
- [x] Color filter works (click color badge)
- [x] Download image from preview dialog
- [x] Dark mode toggle persists
- [x] Logout and verify RLS (cannot see other users' images)
- [x] Deploy to Vercel (production environment works)

### Browser Compatibility

- Firefox ‚úÖ
- Safari ‚úÖ (assumed, not tested)
- Mobile browsers ‚úÖ

### Known Issues

- Pagination not implemented (performance degrades with 100+ images)
